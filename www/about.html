			The Engineering and Commerce Case Competition is an annual case competition focused on showcasing collaborative excellence between the engineering and business disciplines. It is designed to simulate a real world product development scenario which allows participants to demonstrate their excellence in both their given discipline as well as collaborative skills that are needed to be successful in their future careers. In this year’s installment of the competition, 10 universities from 4 countries (Canada, Mexico, Egypt and Israel) will attempt to solve 3 interdisciplinary cases starting on the 10th and ending on the 14th of March 2015.
		</br></br>
		&nbsp	The setting of the competition allows students to network with each other and with ECCC’s corporate partners. This international networking opportunity can prove beneficial for Concordia students and also students from other participating universities. Hosting a high quality and innovative case competition such as ECCC, could also serve as a step forward for provincial, national, and international recognition of Concordia University as a platform for novelty and ingenuity in education and student development. 
		</br></br>
		&nbsp	The competition will also serve as a recruitment platform for its external partners. The CV and information of all volunteers and participants will be included in the yearly “ECCC Talent Bank” and will be distributed to all corporate partners. By doing this, ECCC is attempting to help local and international talents find a career they are looking for and it is also assisting organizations that practice corporate citizenship.
