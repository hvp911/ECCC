Universidad Iberoamericana is considered one of the top institutions of higher education in Mexico. Its mission is to accomplish the full development of its students as the entrepreneurs, professionals, teachers, and researchers that Mexico needs, with a manifest social awareness. One of the University objectives is to impulse students to act creatively by their own initiative and give solution to worldâ€™s current problems.
<br/>
In its undergraduate and graduate programs, Ibero truly cares about having multicultural students promoting studying abroad. The university has external links with other universities in several other countries, giving the opportunity to the students to visit new places as well as acquire new experiences learning from other cultures, which helps self-efficiency and independence.
Ibero is committed to making people passionate and curious about what they are doing and offer help whenever it is needed. This will take our society closer to the goals we aspire.
