Ryerson University has been established for being a national leader in promoting entrepreneurship and innovation. This reputation is largely due to the knowledge and skills that its students gain from the classroom and the collaborations and initiatives they take on with their fellow students outside the classroom.
<br/>

The Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science and the Ted Rogers School of Management students who will represent Ryerson University have a strong foundation in the principles of best practices and processes. They also bring with a spirit of mitigated risk taking that will benefit any organization looking to make value added change to their organization.
