        &nbsp;	McGill University is one of Canada's best-known institutions of higher learning and one of the
        leading universities in the world. With students coming to McGill from some 150 countries, our
        student body is the most internationally diverse of any research-intensive university in the
        country. McGill was founded in 1821 thanks to a generous bequest by James McGill, and since
        then, we've grown from a small college to a bustling university with two campuses, 11 faculties,
        some 300 programs of study, and more than 37,500 students. The University also partners with
        four affiliated teaching hospitals to graduate over 1,000 health care professionals each year.

		&nbsp;	McGill is recognized around the world for the excellence of its teaching and research programs. Ernest Rutherford's Nobel Prize-winning research on the nature of radioactivity was conducted at McGill, part of a long tradition of innovation on our campuses that includes the invention of the artificial blood cell and Plexiglas. Today our professors are building the new field of epigenetics, developing alternative energy sources from crop plants and driving human achievement in every field imaginable.  Our 250,000+ graduates form a vast global network, with many alumni reaching the top of their professions as Supreme Court Justices, award-winning authors and musicians, astronauts and more.
