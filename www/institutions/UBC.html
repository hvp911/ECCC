The University of British Columbia is a global centre for research and teaching, consistently ranked among the 40 best universities in the world. Since 1915, UBCâ€™s West Coast spirit has embraced innovation and challenged the status quo. Its entrepreneurial perspective encourages students, staff and faculty to challenge convention, lead discovery and explore new ways of learning. At UBC, bold thinking is given a place to develop into ideas that can change the world.As recently appointed President and Vice-Chancellor, I want to extend a warm welcome to all of you, whether you are already part of the UBC family or if, at this moment, you are thinking of including UBC in your future educational, formative or professional career plans.
			<br/><br/>

Leading UBC is an honour and a privilege. It is a challenge I embrace wholeheartedly and I am committed to our pursuit of academic excellence in learning, teaching, discovery and innovation. We will meet this mandate in an environment that is inclusive, respectful, and mutually supportive.
			<br/><br/>

Our community has a responsibility to make sure we give those who study at UBC every opportunity for life-long success. I am grateful to our faculty and staff who fulfill this mandate each and every day. There is no better investment we can make as a province and as a country than ensuring our students have the tools to succeed in a rapidly evolving world. At UBC, we strive to produce critical thinkers with a hunger to give back to their communities. Our institution takes great pride in its community of alumni, more than 300,000 strong, who are achieving excellence in all walks of life, engaging in civil debate, and helping to foster success in the next generation.
			<br/><br/>

All of us at UBC will continue working together to create an environment that encourages a global perspective across all endeavors. Our campuses are a place for open and respectful debate that welcomes diversity in our students, faculty and staff. I encourage you to consider what contributions you can make to UBC and look forward to the bold innovations and new thinking you will spark in our shared journey.
