		Concordia University, located in the vibrant and cosmopolitan city of Montreal, Quebec, is one of Canada’s most innovative and diverse, comprehensive universities. Dedicated to academic excellence, a stimulating student experience and community involvement, Concordia prepares its graduates to live as informed, forward-thinking and engaged citizens committed to the spirit of inquiry. The university offers more than 300 undergraduate and 200 graduate programs, diplomas and certificates through four Faculties and a School of Extended Learning. Concordia’s research profile is growing and promotes cross-discipline approaches to some of the most pressing environmental, economic, technological, social and creative challenges currently facing society.

Concordia's reputation as one of Canada’s most dynamic and innovative universities has its roots in over 180 years of pursuing academic excellence and student success. This tradition of individual empowerment, discovery and leadership building was developed by the University’s founding institutions - Loyola College and Sir George Williams University - and continues to flourish locally, nationally and on the global stage. Learn more about our rich history. The university offers a wide range of on-campus resources, such as the many recreation and athletic programs, the student-driven Sustainable Concordia initiative, our libraries, computer and bookstores, art galleries and performance venues, and much more. A university would not be complete without its student associations. Your experience at Concordia will be enhanced by your involvement in the many varied organizations that contribute to the enrichment of student life on campus.
