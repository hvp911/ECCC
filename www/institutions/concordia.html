        &nbsp;	Concordia University, located in the vibrant and cosmopolitan city of Montreal, Quebec, is one
        of Canada’s most innovative and diverse, comprehensive universities. Dedicated to academic
        excellence, a stimulating student experience and community involvement, Concordia prepares
        its graduates to live as informed, forward-thinking and engaged citizens committed to the spirit
        of inquiry. The university offers more than 300 undergraduate and 200 graduate programs,
        diplomas and certificates through four Faculties and a School of Extended Learning. Concordia’s
        research profile is growing and promotes cross-discipline approaches to some of the most

        <br><br>
		
		&nbsp;	Concordia's reputation as one of Canada’s most dynamic and innovative universities has its
        roots in over 180 years of pursuing academic excellence and student success. This tradition of
        individual empowerment, discovery and leadership building was developed by the University’s
        founding institutions - Loyola College and Sir George Williams University - and continues to
        flourish locally, nationally and on the global stage. Learn more about our rich history.
         <br><br>
        
          &nbsp;    The university offers a wide range of on-campus resources, such as the many recreation and
        athletic programs, the student-driven Sustainable Concordia initiative, our libraries, computer
        and bookstores, art galleries and performance venues, and much more. A university would not
        be complete without its student associations. Your experience at Concordia will be enhanced by
        your involvement in the many varied organizations that contribute to the enrichment of student
        life on campus.
