        &nbsp; The University of Guelph is one of Canada's highest ranked comprehensive universities, according to the Maclean's survey, and continues to be the educational destination of choice for both Canadian and international students. This ranking reflects Guelph's distinctiveness as a high-quality, student-focused, residentially-intensive university that is committed to innovative programs, dynamic student-faculty interaction, and an integration of learning and research.
        <br/> <br/>
        
       &nbsp; Education on the Guelph campus has a long tradition, beginning over one hundred years ago when the Ontario government purchased a five hundred-acre farm from Frederick William Stone for its new School of Agriculture. In this promising location, the Ontario School of Agriculture opened its doors on May 1, 1874.
